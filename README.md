Programming in Python is a beginner-friendly collection of simple Python programs designed to help newcomers grasp the basics of the language. This set includes fundamental topics such as printing output, working with variables and data types, taking user input, using conditional statements (if, elif, else), implementing loops (for and while), defining functions, handling lists, tuples, and dictionaries, as well as performing basic file operations. The folder also features small projects like a simple calculator to reinforce learning through hands-on practice. All programs are written in Python 3 and can be run directly using the python filename.py command. This collection serves as a practical starting point for those who want to build a strong foundation in Python programming through clear and concise examples.
